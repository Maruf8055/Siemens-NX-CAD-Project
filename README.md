# Siemens-NX-CAD-Project


## Overview
The Rotating Parking Structure project aims to address urban parking challenges by providing an efficient, space-saving solution. Utilizing NX CAD for design, the project incorporates a rotating mechanism to maximize parking space usage, making it an ideal solution for densely populated areas. This innovative design minimizes the time spent searching for parking, enhances user experience

##Problem Statement:
The design process for a 3D parking structure is inefficient, resulting in increased production costs, longer lead times, and potential errors in assembly. Without a streamlined approach to CAD modeling and effective management of engineering guidance, teams face difficulties in meeting project deadlines while ensuring the quality and performance of the structure.

## Libraries and Tools Used
NX CAD: Used for 3D modeling and design of the rotating parking structure.

## Features
Rotating mechanism to save space and reduce vehicle retrieval time.
Elevator system for vertical movement, allowing cars to go up and down.
The top section moves in the opposite direction to the bottom section for efficient parking.
Operated by a gear system for smooth and reliable functionality.


## How to Run
1. Clone the Repo
2. Install Dependencies
4. Launch the Project Open the project files in NX CAD or the relevant CAD software to view the design and simulate operations.
